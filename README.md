# Homework

This is a set of tools that helps students in GSMST to deal with the homework! It may also benefits your workflow for students in other schools!

## How to Use

Download the file in this repository, then run the following commands on your computer.

 1. You need to download python.
    - [Python Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - For students who do not have administrator privilege, when you download python, you should uncheck "install for all the users" when installing python
    - if you have chocolatey, `choco install python`
 2. Some scripts in this repo contain an auto drawing function. If you want to use them, please run `pip install matplotlib`
    - If you can't install `matplotlib` in the school network, you may run these commands when connected to your own internet.
    - You may also use `pip install <wheel_name>`, by downloading the files from [Pypi](pypi.org). Then you should download and install `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `kiwisolver`, `cycler`, `pillow`, `pyparsing`
 3. Finally, you simply type `cmd` in your file manager(or you can type cmd in search panel and `cd <path_of_script>`), and run 'python <script_name>`

- You may modify the parameter in the function for the correct output for your projects. Because this script is simply a handy solver, it DOES NOT CONTAIN view components. That is, you have to change the codes to gain desired results. Otherwise, you only get test inputs and results!
